trying to make a templating engine work
Apparrently jade is now pug which suck because jade 
sounds much nicer 

also going to try to use the express generator

Got it working somewhat using tables. 
Also got bootstrap included which doesn't seem to help much with the table.
Need to try with normal bootstrap grids and try to get working with pug 


Some stuff on using socketio with pug
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42146569/im-trying-to-re-render-my-pug-template-through-setinterval-is-this-possible

Ok interesting question is how do you link the socket.io on the client? Do you need to depend on a remote server cdn or can you supply when you serve page. My basic example
seemed to include the local dependency on the server but use a cdn on the client. Is that standard?


Can't figure out how to integrate socket io with default structure laid out in myapp. Restarted from scratch.
