Current thought / plans for project:

Evolving as I go because there's a lot to learn.

Stack:
Leaning towards express, angular and socket.io at this point.
Going to try to build from scratch as much as possible because I'm
having trouble understanding the generated projects

Serverside:
Has a library of tests programs to choose from (node modules for running tests fixture automation etc.). Once selected, the 
module will communicated a json object containing all the relevent information about its state (count, outputs on/of, motor position).
The different field are marked as editiable or not. This object is emitted via socket whenever state changes.

Also will serve up a static page for the test program containing documaention on the program , maybe pictures of related fixtures etc. 

Client side:
Recieves the state object and renders a table with inputs for the editible fields. When new object is recieved via socket, table is updated. 
Client sends object back via socket when edited for values to be updated on client side. Table is bound to object values via angular.
